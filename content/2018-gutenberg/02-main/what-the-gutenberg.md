Gutenberg is the new visual editing experience for WordPress.

This is the replacement for what we are now calling the "Classic Editor"

> The editor will create a new page- and post-building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.
